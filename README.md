# PythonBot 
An project about a Automate Bot with Python technology (Using ChromeDriver and Selenium)

I did this project in an extraclass course, to learn how I can use ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Python.svg)  (**Python**) to automate simple tasks that I use in my daily life. In this projects, I did a Bot to do finds on especific sites ('Registro.com'), this project is named "ProjetoWebScrap". Did too a Bot to send auto e-mails with the infos I need to send.

Also in this folder, we have as project named "GoogleBot", which search a word or phrases requested by the user and save in an archive txt with their references.

The level of this projects is Easy.
